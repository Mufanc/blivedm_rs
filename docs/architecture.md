# Architecture of BliveDm_rs

## Preliminaries

The previous version of the documentation can be found [here](https://open-live.bilibili.com/document/657d8e34-f926-a133-16c0-300c1afc6e6b) (as of 2024). In April 2025, Bilibili released an updated [documentation page](https://open.bilibili.com/doc/4/19350a57-2e2d-43cf-3e6d-c7de132b24b6). 

The main difference in the new documentation is the requirement to use OAuth 2.0 for live functions. This means developers must register on the Bilibili Open Platform. However, due to increased risk controls, live features may no longer be available to **personal developers** in the future. As a result, the old version of the API may eventually stop working.
